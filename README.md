# Media Server Home Lab
## Introduction

I developed a self-hosted media server using Jellyfin to strengthen my technical skills and gain hands-on experience with home lab projects. My goal was to create a system that allowed me to stream TV shows and movies throughout my home while also challenging myself with new technologies.
<br>
<br>
To maximize my learning, I built the server on Linux (Ubuntu) and primarily used the terminal for configuration and troubleshooting. While this was a beginner-level project for some, it was my first technical build, and it pushed me to problem-solve issues I had never encountered before.
<br>
<br>
This project not only gave me practical experience with system setup and Linux commands but also reinforced my perseverance, troubleshooting skills, and ability to learn independentlyâ€”key qualities I bring to IT and cybersecurity roles.

## The Process
I had an old computer collecting dust. After doing some research and many home labs start with. At this point, I'm not too familar with the Linux operating system, so I took it as an opportunity to get more familiar with it.  
<br>
This is my first home lab project I took this opportunity to use Ubuntu operating system. This of course would have a learning curve. The more experience and familiarity I have working under a Linux distribution would do me well since Linux is commonly used in IT and cyber security professional. I'm too familar with the Graphical User Interface and not used to using the terminal.

First, I used the instuctions on the Jellyfin website to use the Linux terminal to download Jellyfin<. It is different from what I'm used to with Windows, downloading from the website and then from that application using an install wizard compared to opening the terminal and sending a command line and downloading direcetly from that.

<br>
It was simple enough, but I was excited that I was successfully able to install it through Linux.

but, there is an issue. It wasn't populating. There was some issue.
