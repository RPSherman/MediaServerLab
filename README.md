# Media Server Home Lab
## Introduction

Because I have limited technical skills, I wanted to do a technical project to learn and have something cool for myself.  The idea of creating my own self-hosted media server where I can watch TV shows or movies whereever in my home was very appealling. 
<br>
<br>
I wanted to further my learning by using an unfamilar operating system to myself, Linux: Ubuntu, and using it's terminal.
This project may have been easy for some, but this was my first home lab project. Doing this project for me was at times frustrating often hitting issues I wouldn't know at all how to resolve but it was so satisfying for me to continue to try and push through and eventually figure it out.

## So it begins..
I had an old computer collecting dust. After doing some research and many home labs start with. At this point, I'm not too familar with the Linux operating system, so I took it as an opportunity to get more familiar with it.

  This is my first home lab project I took this opportunity to use Ubuntu operating system. This of course would have a learning curve
